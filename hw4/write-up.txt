I believe I was 85% successful with this program. Using Professor
Moloney's class code as a base, I wrote the producer and consumer
functions as described in pseudo code. However, some errors occrred
while writing this program. For whatever reason, multiple PIDS appear
when running the program and it causes the program to deadlock
every time. I'm not sure why this error occurrs, and I spent several
hours trying to figure out why, but was unsuccessful. As a result of
this, data collection was essentially impossible. I assume that
much like the last assignment, the correct results would be as the
queue gets larger, the probability of deadlock decreases. And as for
altering the number of dozen of donuts, I would guess that the more dozen
of donuts produced the greater the probability of deadlock. While I did
not get this program 100% working, I do think that I implemented the
pseudo code correctly, I just don't know what caused the program to
create more pids than expected and always deadlock as a result.
