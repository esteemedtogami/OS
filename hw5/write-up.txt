I believe I was 60% successful with this program. Using Professor Moloney's
class code and the class website help files, I tried to implement first
and best fit algorithms. Even though the program compiles, it seems to
run into a segmentation fault. Considering Professor Moloney said that
Buddy System is very challenging to code and that most people have trouble
implementing it, in the end, trying to implement it caused more errors,
so I removed it entirely. I do understand what buddy system is; when
trying to allocate space for an object, you essentially continue to break
free space in half until you find a size just big enough to contain the
object you are allocating memory for, and the memory cannot coalesce until
its adjacent memory matches its size and is free.
